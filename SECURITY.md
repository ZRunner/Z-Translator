# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please report security issues only for the latest versions of the project, *ie* the branch "master" and any other active dev branch.

Other versions are not used anymore and should not be used.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The best way to report vulnerabilities is by opening an issue on GitHub, which allows you to check if the vulnerability has already
been reported, and allows people to track its fix.

For major security issues which should not be revealed, you can also send me an email (from my profile page), or contact me throught Discord (Z_runner#7515).
